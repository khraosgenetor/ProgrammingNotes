The syllabus for assembly programming typically covers the fundamentals of low-level programming and hardware interaction. Here's a breakdown of what a typical assembly language syllabus might look like, especially for x64 architecture:

### 1. **Introduction to Low-Level Hardware**

- [[1.1 Understanding the binary system (bits and bytes)]]
- [[1.2 The concept of data representation in memory (integers, floating points)]]
- Memory addresses, byte-ordering (big-endian vs little-endian)
- How the CPU and memory interact: registers, buses, and cache
- Basic understanding of logic gates, flip-flops, and circuits
- Digital systems: from bits to bytes, to words, to long words
- Hardware components (RAM, ROM, CPU, I/O devices)
- Introduction to assembly's relationship with hardware

### 2. **Understanding Assembly Language and the CPU Architecture**

- Architecture of a modern CPU (x86-64, ARM, etc.)
- Internal structure: ALU, registers, buses, and control units
- Basic instruction set and machine code (from assembly to binary)
- The role of the instruction pointer, stack pointer, and other key registers
- Data path and control path of a CPU

### 3. **Basic Syntax and Structure**

- Basic structure of an assembly program
- Labels, instructions, and comments
- Defining data sections: `.data`, `.bss`, `.text`
- Working with registers: general-purpose, segment, and flag registers
- Writing basic programs (Hello World)

### 4. **Data Representation and Operations**

- Representing data in binary, hexadecimal, and decimal
- Data types (byte, word, dword, qword)
- Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shifts)
- Immediate, direct, and indirect addressing modes

### 5. **Control Flow and Branching**

- Jump instructions (`jmp`, `je`, `jne`, `jg`, `jl`, etc.)
- Conditional branching (using flags like ZF, SF, OF)
- Loops: `loop`, `for`, `while` constructs
- Function calls and returns (`call`, `ret`)

### 6. **Working with the Stack**

- The stack and stack pointer (SP)
- Push and pop instructions
- Function prologues and epilogues
- Stack frames and local variables
- Call conventions (e.g., x64 System V ABI)
- Understanding `rsp`, `rbp`, and stack overflow

### 7. **Subroutines and Procedures**

- Defining and calling subroutines
- Passing arguments and returning values (registers vs stack)
- Handling local variables
- Recursion in assembly
- Writing modular code in assembly

### 8. **Memory Management**

- Working with data in memory (using registers to access memory)
- The heap and dynamic memory allocation
- Using pointers for memory access
- Memory segments: `.data`, `.bss`, `.text`
- Basic memory protection mechanisms

### 9. **Interrupts and System Calls**

- Understanding interrupts and how to use them
- Using software interrupts (e.g., `int 0x80` in Linux)
- System calls for I/O (reading from stdin, writing to stdout)
- Handling hardware interrupts (e.g., timer interrupt)

### 10. **File I/O and String Operations**

- Reading from and writing to files in assembly
- Using system calls for I/O (`open`, `read`, `write`, `close`)
- Manipulating strings in memory
- Implementing string functions (copy, compare, length)

### 11. **Working with Firmware**

- What is firmware and how it differs from software
- Writing basic firmware for embedded systems
- Bootloaders and system initialization code
- Flashing firmware to microcontrollers and memory devices
- Managing I/O operations and system peripherals (GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C)

### 12. **Designing and Creating PCBs for Custom Boards**

- Introduction to PCB design: What is a PCB and its components?
- Understanding electrical schematics and circuits
- Designing PCBs using tools like KiCad or Eagle
- Soldering, component placement, and layout considerations
- Fabrication process: from design to the finished PCB
- Debugging and testing PCBs
- Interfacing custom boards with firmware (e.g., using microcontrollers)

### 13. **Advanced Topics**

- SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions (e.g., `SSE`, `AVX`)
- Working with floating-point numbers (FPU)
- Understanding CPU cache and memory hierarchy
- Optimization techniques in assembly (e.g., loop unrolling, inlining)
- Debugging and profiling assembly code
- Reverse engineering basics

### 14. **Assembly in the Context of Operating Systems**

- Bootloaders and operating system kernels
- Writing device drivers
- Low-level system initialization
- Memory management in OS

### 15. **Tools for Assembly Programming**

- Assembler tools (e.g., NASM, GAS)
- Linking and debugging assembly code (e.g., GDB, LLDB)
- Writing and testing assembly in a virtual machine or emulator (e.g., QEMU, Bochs)

### 16. **Project Work**

- Writing a simple operating system or kernel in assembly
- Building a small system utility (e.g., a calculator or text editor)
- Designing custom firmware and interfacing with PCB hardware
- Reverse-engineering simple software using assembly
