## Overview

Data representation in memory is the process of storing data in a binary format that can be accessed and manipulated by a computer's processor. The two primary data types involved in this representation are **integers** and **floating-point numbers**.

## Integers

Integers are whole numbers, positive or negative, that do not have any fractional component.

### Representation of Integers
- **Signed Integers**: Integers can either be positive or negative. Computers use two’s complement representation to handle signed integers. 
    - **Two's complement** allows computers to represent both positive and negative numbers using the same bit-width.
    - The most significant bit (MSB, or leftmost bit) is used to represent the sign:
        - `0` in the MSB indicates a positive number.
        - `1` in the MSB indicates a negative number.
    
    For example, in an **8-bit system**:
    - **+5** in binary: `00000101`
    - **-5** in binary: `11111011`
    
    - **Two’s complement** is useful because it simplifies the design of arithmetic circuits in CPUs, allowing for addition and subtraction to work seamlessly across both positive and negative numbers.

- **Unsigned Integers**: These are always non-negative. All bits are used to represent the magnitude of the number, so an unsigned integer can store larger values compared to a signed integer of the same bit-width.
    - Example (8-bit unsigned integer):
        - The number `5` is represented as `00000101` (same as signed representation for positive values).
        - The largest value that can be stored in an 8-bit unsigned integer is `255`, represented as `11111111`.

### Integer Range
- For an **n-bit signed integer**, the range of values is from \(-2^{(n-1)}\) to \(2^{(n-1)} - 1\).
- For an **n-bit unsigned integer**, the range of values is from \(0\) to \(2^n - 1\).

#### Example:
- For an **8-bit signed integer**: Range = \([-128, 127]\)
- For an **8-bit unsigned integer**: Range = \([0, 255]\)

## Floating-Point Numbers

Floating-point numbers are numbers that have both integer and fractional parts, typically represented in scientific notation. They are used to represent real numbers that require a larger dynamic range than integers.

### IEEE 754 Standard
The **IEEE 754** standard defines how floating-point numbers are represented in memory. It is widely used in modern computers for storing floating-point numbers.

A floating-point number is represented in the form:

$$
\text{Sign} \times \text{Mantissa} \times 2^{\text{Exponent}}
$$

#### Single Precision (32-bit)
- **Sign bit (1 bit)**: Indicates if the number is positive or negative.
- **Exponent (8 bits)**: Represents the exponent in a biased form (the exponent is stored with a bias of 127).
- **Mantissa (23 bits)**: The fractional part of the number, with an implicit leading 1 (for normalized values).

The general structure for single precision:
- **1 bit** for the sign
- **8 bits** for the exponent
- **23 bits** for the mantissa

#### Example of Single Precision:
For the floating-point number **-6.75**:
1. **Convert to binary**:  
    - Integer part: \(6 \rightarrow 110\)
    - Fractional part: \(0.75 \rightarrow .11\)
    - So, \(6.75 = 110.11_2\)
2. **Normalized scientific notation**:  
    - \(110.11_2 = 1.1011_2 \times 2^2\)
3. **Sign bit**: Since it's negative, the sign bit is `1`.
4. **Exponent**: Exponent is \(2\), and with a bias of 127, the stored exponent is \(2 + 127 = 129\) (binary: `10000001`).
5. **Mantissa**: The fractional part is `1011`, so the mantissa is `10110000000000000000000`.

The final 32-bit representation is:

| Sign         | Exponent (8 bits) | Mantissa (23 bits)      |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1            | 10000001          | 10110000000000000000000 |


#### Double Precision (64-bit)
- **1 bit** for the sign
- **11 bits** for the exponent (with a bias of 1023)
- **52 bits** for the mantissa

This allows for greater precision and a larger range of numbers compared to single precision.

### Special Floating-Point Values
- **Zero**: Represented by all bits being zero, except for the sign bit.
- **Infinity**: Represented by all exponent bits being 1 and all mantissa bits being 0.
- **Not a Number (NaN)**: Represented by all exponent bits being 1 and non-zero mantissa bits.

### Floating-Point Range
- The range of floating-point numbers is determined by the exponent. For single precision, the exponent is an 8-bit value with a bias of 127, giving an exponent range of \([-126, 127]\) (after adjusting for the bias).

## Comparison of Integer and Floating-Point Representation

| Feature                    | Integer Representation                   | Floating-Point Representation          |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Range**                  | Limited by the number of bits (signed or unsigned) | Wide dynamic range, but limited precision |
| **Precision**              | Exact, as integers don’t have fractional parts | Approximate, precision is limited by mantissa size |
| **Common Usage**           | Counting, indexing, and discrete values    | Scientific calculations, real numbers, measurements |
| **Memory Efficiency**      | More memory-efficient for storing exact values | Requires more memory for precision but can represent larger values |

## Summary

- **Integers** represent whole numbers and are stored in binary, using either signed (two’s complement) or unsigned formats.
- **Floating-point numbers** represent real numbers and follow the IEEE 754 standard, using a sign, exponent, and mantissa to store values.
- Understanding how data is represented in memory is crucial for efficient programming, especially when dealing with different data types and their associated operations.
