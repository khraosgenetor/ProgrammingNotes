# 1.1 Understanding the Binary System (Bits and Bytes)

## What is Binary?

- The **binary system** is a way of representing numbers using only two digits: **0** and **1**. These digits are called **bits** (short for "binary digits").
- Computers use the binary system because digital electronics work with two distinct states: **on (1)** and **off (0)**, represented by electrical voltage (high for 1, low for 0).

## Bits (Binary Digits)

- **Bit**: The smallest unit of data in computing, representing a single value of **0** or **1**.
- A sequence of bits can represent numbers, characters, and more complex data.
    - **1 bit**: Can represent two values (0 or 1).
    - **2 bits**: Can represent four values (00, 01, 10, 11).
    - **n bits**: Can represent \( 2^n \) values.

## Bytes

- A **byte** is a group of **8 bits**. It is the standard unit of storage in computers.
    - **1 byte** = 8 bits.
    - A byte can represent 256 different values (from **00000000** to **11111111** in binary), or **0 to 255** in decimal.
- Bytes are used to store characters, numbers, and other data in computers.

## Converting Between Number Systems

- **Decimal (Base 10)**: The standard number system that uses digits **0-9**.
- **Binary (Base 2)**: Uses only **0** and **1**.
- **Hexadecimal (Base 16)**: Uses digits **0-9** and letters **A-F** to represent values 0 to 15.

### Decimal to Binary Conversion

To convert a decimal number to binary, divide the number by 2 repeatedly and record the remainders:

- Example: Convert **13** (decimal) to binary:
    1. 13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1
    2. 6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0
    3. 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1
    4. 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1
    
    - Reading the remainders from bottom to top: **13** (decimal) = **1101** (binary)

### Binary to Decimal Conversion

To convert a binary number to decimal, multiply each bit by \( 2^n \), where **n** is the position of the bit (starting from 0 on the right):

- Example: Convert **1101** (binary) to decimal:
    $$
    - 1 \times 2^3 + 1 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13
    $$

### Binary to Hexadecimal Conversion

Every 4 bits can be directly represented as a hexadecimal digit:

- Example: Convert **1101** (binary) to hexadecimal:
    - Group the binary number into 4-bit chunks: **1101**.
    - **1101** = **D** in hexadecimal.

## Byte and Word Sizes

- **Word**: A group of bytes, typically 2 or 4 bytes depending on the architecture. For x86-64 systems, a word is typically **4 bytes** (32 bits).
- **Double word**: 8 bytes (64 bits).
- **Quad word**: 16 bytes (128 bits).

## Data Representation in Binary

- **Numbers**: In binary, numbers are represented as sequences of bits, with each bit contributing to the overall value. For example, **1101** represents the decimal value **13**.
- **Characters**: Each character is typically represented by a byte using a character encoding scheme like **ASCII** or **UTF-8**.
    - Example: The ASCII code for **A** is **65**, which is **01000001** in binary.

## Endianness (Byte Order)

- **Big-endian**: The most significant byte (MSB) is stored first.
- **Little-endian**: The least significant byte (LSB) is stored first.
    - Example:
        - 16-bit value **0x1234** (hexadecimal) in little-endian: **34 12** (low byte first).
        - 16-bit value **0x1234** (hexadecimal) in big-endian: **12 34** (high byte first).

## Practical Uses of Binary

- **Memory**: Computers store data in binary form in memory. Every bit is stored in a physical location (cell) in memory.
- **CPU operations**: The central processing unit (CPU) performs arithmetic and logic operations using binary numbers.
- **Communication**: Data transmitted between devices (networking, storage) is often encoded in binary.

## Summary

- Binary (base 2) is the foundation of all digital computing systems. It’s crucial to understand bits and bytes, as they are fundamental to data storage, processing, and transmission in computers.
- By mastering binary, you can better understand how hardware works, how programs execute, and how low-level systems manage data.
