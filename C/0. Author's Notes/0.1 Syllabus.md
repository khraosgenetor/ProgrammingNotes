- **Variables and Constants**: Declaration, initialization, scope, and lifetime of variables.
- **Operators**: Arithmetic, logical, relational, bitwise, and assignment operators.
- **Control Structures**: If-else, switch-case, loops (for, while, do-while).
- **Functions**: Function declaration, definition, parameters, return values, recursion, variable scope.
- **Arrays**: One-dimensional arrays, two-dimensional arrays, array initialization.
- **Strings**: String handling, character arrays, string manipulation (without `string.h` methods).

### 2. **Pointers and Memory Management**

- **Pointers Basics**: Pointer declaration, dereferencing, pointer types.
- **Pointer Arithmetic**: Accessing memory, pointer addition/subtraction, pointer comparison.
- **Arrays and Pointers**: Understanding arrays as pointers, using pointers to navigate arrays.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: `malloc()`, `calloc()`, `free()`, and manual memory management.
- **Function Pointers**: Basics of function pointers, callback functions.
- **Memory Layout**: Stack vs heap, stack overflow, memory leaks, and buffer overflow.

### 3. **Advanced C Programming Concepts**

- **Structures**: Defining structs, using structs in functions, passing structs by reference/value.
- **Unions**: Defining and using unions.
- **Bit Manipulation**: Using bitwise operators for setting, clearing, and toggling bits.
- **Typecasting**: Implicit and explicit casting, pointers, and structures.
- **Enumerations**: Basic usage and benefits of `enum` types.

### 4. **File Handling (Optional for OS Development)**

- **File I/O Basics**: Opening, reading, writing, and closing files.
- **File Pointers**: `fseek()`, `ftell()`, `fgetc()`, `fputc()`.
- **Binary File Handling**: Reading and writing binary data.

### 5. **Advanced Memory Management**

- **Stack and Heap Management**: Manual memory management in both areas, memory leaks.
- **Virtual Memory (Conceptual)**: Basic understanding of virtual vs. physical memory, page tables (if you want to dive deeper later).

### 6. **Compiler and Linker Basics**

- **Compiling a C Program**: Using `gcc`, understanding flags (`-o`, `-g`, `-Wall`, etc.).
- **Linking**: Static vs dynamic linking, library linking, shared libraries, resolving symbols.
- **Makefiles**: Basics of writing `Makefile` to automate the build process.

### 7. **Debugging Techniques**

- **Using GDB**: Setting breakpoints, stepping through code, inspecting variables, stack traces, and core dumps.
- **Print Debugging**: Using `printf()` and logging to troubleshoot issues.
- **Memory Debugging Tools**: `valgrind`, `asan` for detecting memory leaks.

### 8. **Data Structures (For OS Development)**

- **Linked Lists**: Basic singly, doubly, and circular linked lists, intrusive linked lists.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implementing and using stacks and queues in C.
- **Hash Tables**: Concept of hashing, implementing basic hash maps (optional).
- **Binary Trees**: Simple tree structures, balanced trees (optional).
- **Graphs**: Representing graphs with adjacency lists/matrices (optional).

### 9. **Low-Level Programming Concepts**

- **Assembly Language Basics**: Understanding CPU instructions, registers, and memory operations (optional).
- **Inline Assembly in C**: Using assembly within C code (optional, for advanced topics).
- **System Registers**: Understanding CPU registers and their role in system programming.
- **Interrupts and Exception Handling**: Basic understanding of how interrupts work at the hardware level.

### 10. **System Programming and Operating System Development**

- **Bootloaders**: Understanding the role of bootloaders in loading the kernel (e.g., GRUB, writing a basic bootloader).
- **Kernel Basics**: Writing a basic kernel that can execute code directly on hardware.
- **Freestanding Environments**: Developing without standard C libraries (no `stdlib.h`, `stdio.h`, etc.).
- **Memory Management in the Kernel**: Implementing memory allocation in an OS kernel.
- **I/O Operations**: Basic understanding of interacting with hardware devices through memory-mapped I/O.
- **Multithreading and Scheduling**: Concepts of processes, threads, and how to manage them in a kernel environment.
- **System Calls**: How to implement system calls to interact with kernel services.
- **Interrupt Handling in OS**: Setting up and handling interrupts in the kernel.
- **Porting to Different Architectures**: Understanding how to adapt your OS for different hardware architectures (e.g., x86, ARM).

### 11. **Cross-Compilation**

- **Setting up a Cross-Compiler**: Configuring and using cross-compilers for building an OS for a different architecture than your host machine.
- **Targeting Different Architectures**: How to cross-compile for architectures like x86, ARM, etc.

### 12. **Emulator Setup and Usage**

- **QEMU**: Setting up and using QEMU to emulate hardware and test your kernel.
- **Virtual Machines**: Using virtual machines for testing your OS kernel.

### 13. **Final Advanced Topics (Optional for OS Development)**

- **File Systems**: Understanding how to create and manage file systems at a low level.
- **Concurrency and Synchronization**: Implementing synchronization mechanisms like mutexes, semaphores, and atomic operations.
- **Security and Protection**: Concepts of memory protection, privilege levels, and basic security in OS development.
