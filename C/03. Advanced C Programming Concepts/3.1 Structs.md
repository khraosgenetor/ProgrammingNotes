### **Structs in C/C++**

**Structs** are user-defined data types that allow grouping of variables under a single name. These variables can be of different data types.

### **Defining Structs**

To define a struct, use the `struct` keyword. For example:

```c
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};
```

Here, `Point` is a struct that contains two integer members: `x` and `y`.

### **Using Structs**

1. **Declaring Variables**  
    Struct variables can be declared as follows:
    
    ```c
    struct Point p1;
    ```
    
    Access members using the dot operator:
    
    ```c
    p1.x = 10;
    p1.y = 20;
    ```
    
2. **Initializing Structs**  
    Structs can be initialized when declared:
    
    ```c
    struct Point p2 = {30, 40};
    ```

### **Passing Structs in Functions**

1. **Passing by Value**  
    When passed by value, the function gets a copy of the struct. Changes in the function do not affect the original struct.
    
    ```c
    void printPoint(struct Point p) {
        printf("Point: (%d, %d)\n", p.x, p.y);
    }
    ```
    
2. **Passing by Reference**  
    To modify the original struct, pass it by reference using pointers.
    
    ```c
    void updatePoint(struct Point *p, int newX, int newY) {
        p->x = newX;
        p->y = newY;
    }
    ```
    

---

### **Code Examples**

1. **Basic Struct Definition and Usage**
    
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    struct Point {
        int x;
        int y;
    };
    
    int main() {
        struct Point p1 = {10, 20};
        printf("Point: (%d, %d)\n", p1.x, p1.y);
    
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    
2. **Passing Struct by Value**
    
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    struct Point {
        int x;
        int y;
    };
    
    void printPoint(struct Point p) {
        printf("Point: (%d, %d)\n", p.x, p.y);
    }
    
    int main() {
        struct Point p1 = {10, 20};
        printPoint(p1);
    
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    
3. **Passing Struct by Reference**
    
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    struct Point {
        int x;
        int y;
    };
    
    void updatePoint(struct Point *p, int newX, int newY) {
        p->x = newX;
        p->y = newY;
    }
    
    int main() {
        struct Point p1 = {10, 20};
        updatePoint(&p1, 50, 60);
        printf("Updated Point: (%d, %d)\n", p1.x, p1.y);
    
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    
4. **Combining Structs with Functions**
    
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    struct Point {
        int x;
        int y;
    };
    
    struct Point createPoint(int x, int y) {
        struct Point p;
        p.x = x;
        p.y = y;
        return p;
    }
    
    int main() {
        struct Point p1 = createPoint(5, 15);
        printf("Created Point: (%d, %d)\n", p1.x, p1.y);
    
        return 0;
    }
    ```

### **Key Points**

1. **Struct vs Class**  
    In C++, `struct` is similar to a class, but members are public by default.
    
2. **Pointer Access (`->`)**  
    Use the arrow operator (`->`) when accessing members through a pointer to a struct.
    
3. **Efficiency**  
    Passing structs by reference is more efficient for large structs, as it avoids copying data.
    
4. **Nested Structs**  
    Structs can have other structs as members, allowing more complex data organization.
