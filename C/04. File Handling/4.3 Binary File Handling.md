### Notes on Binary File Handling in C

#### 1. Introduction to Binary File Handling
- Binary files store data in a format that is not human-readable, allowing for more efficient storage and retrieval of complex data types.
- In C, binary file handling is done using the same file I/O functions, but with specific considerations for reading and writing binary data.

#### 2. Opening Binary Files
- Use the `fopen()` function with the appropriate mode:
  - `"rb"`: Open for reading in binary mode.
  - `"wb"`: Open for writing in binary mode (creates a new file or truncates an existing file).
  - `"ab"`: Open for appending in binary mode.

#### 3. Writing Binary Data
- Use the `fwrite()` function to write binary data to a file.
- **Syntax**:
  ```c
  size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *stream);
  ```
- **Parameters**:
  - `ptr`: Pointer to the data to be written.
  - `size`: Size of each element to be written.
  - `count`: Number of elements to write.
  - `stream`: Pointer to the file.
- **Return Value**: Returns the number of elements successfully written.

#### 4. Reading Binary Data
- Use the `fread()` function to read binary data from a file.
- **Syntax**:
  ```c
  size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *stream);
  ```
- **Parameters**:
  - `ptr`: Pointer to the buffer where the read data will be stored.
  - `size`: Size of each element to be read.
  - `count`: Number of elements to read.
  - `stream`: Pointer to the file.
- **Return Value**: Returns the number of elements successfully read.

#### 5. Example Workflow
1. Open a binary file for writing.
2. Write data to the file using `fwrite()`.
3. Close the file.
4. Open the binary file for reading.
5. Read data from the file using `fread()`.
6. Close the file.

### Example Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef struct {
    int id;
    float score;
} Student;

int main() {
    FILE *file;
    Student students[3] = {
        {1, 85.5},
        {2, 90.0},
        {3, 78.5}
    };

    // Writing binary data to a file
    file = fopen("students.dat", "wb");
    if (file == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening file for writing");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    // Write the array of students to the file
    size_t written = fwrite(students, sizeof(Student), 3, file);
    if (written != 3) {
        perror("Error writing to file");
    }

    fclose(file); // Closing the file

    // Reading binary data from a file
    file = fopen("students.dat", "rb");
    if (file == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening file for reading");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    Student readStudents[3];
    size_t read = fread(readStudents, sizeof(Student), 3, file);
    if (read != 3) {
        perror("Error reading from file");
    }

    // Print the read data
    for (size_t i = 0; i < read; i++) {
        printf("Student ID: %d, Score: %.2f\n", readStudents[i].id, readStudents[i].score);
    }

    fclose(file); // Closing the file
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

### Explanation of the Example Code
- The code defines a `Student` structure containing an `id` and a `score`.
- It creates an array of `Student` structures and opens a binary file named `students.dat` for writing.
- The `fwrite()` function writes the array of students to the file.
- After closing the file, it reopens the same file for reading in binary mode.
- The `fread()` function reads the data back into another array of `Student` structures.
- Finally, it prints the read data to the console, demonstrating successful binary file handling.
