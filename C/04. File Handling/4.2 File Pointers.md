### Notes on File Pointers in C

#### 1. Introduction to File Pointers
- File pointers are used to manage the position of the file stream in C.
- They allow for random access to files, enabling reading and writing at specific locations.

#### 2. Key Functions for File Pointers

##### a. `fseek()`
- **Purpose**: Moves the file pointer to a specific location in the file.
- **Syntax**:
  ```c
  int fseek(FILE *stream, long offset, int whence);
  ```
- **Parameters**:
  - `stream`: Pointer to the file.
  - `offset`: Number of bytes to move the pointer.
  - `whence`: Position from where the offset is applied. It can be:
    - `SEEK_SET`: Beginning of the file.
    - `SEEK_CUR`: Current position of the file pointer.
    - `SEEK_END`: End of the file.
- **Return Value**: Returns 0 on success and a non-zero value on error.

##### b. `ftell()`
- **Purpose**: Returns the current position of the file pointer in the file.
- **Syntax**:
  ```c
  long ftell(FILE *stream);
  ```
- **Parameters**:
  - `stream`: Pointer to the file.
- **Return Value**: Returns the current position as a long integer, or -1 if an error occurs.

##### c. `fgetc()`
- **Purpose**: Reads a single character from the file.
- **Syntax**:
  ```c
  int fgetc(FILE *stream);
  ```
- **Parameters**:
  - `stream`: Pointer to the file.
- **Return Value**: Returns the character read as an unsigned char cast to an int or EOF on end of file or error.

##### d. `fputc()`
- **Purpose**: Writes a single character to the file.
- **Syntax**:
  ```c
  int fputc(int char, FILE *stream);
  ```
- **Parameters**:
  - `char`: The character to write.
  - `stream`: Pointer to the file.
- **Return Value**: Returns the character written as an unsigned char cast to an int or EOF on error.

#### 3. Example Workflow
1. Open a file for reading or writing.
2. Use `fseek()` to move the file pointer to a desired location.
3. Use `ftell()` to check the current position of the file pointer.
4. Use `fgetc()` to read a character or `fputc()` to write a character.
5. Close the file.

### Example Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    FILE *file;
    char ch;
    long position;

    // Opening a file for writing
    file = fopen("example.txt", "w");
    if (file == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    // Writing characters to the file
    fputc('A', file);
    fputc('B', file);
    fputc('C', file);
    fclose(file); // Closing the file

    // Opening the file for reading
    file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
    if (file == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    // Move the file pointer to the beginning
    fseek(file, 0, SEEK_SET);
    position = ftell(file); // Get the current position
    printf("Current position: %ld\n", position); // Should be 0

    // Read and print characters
    while ((ch = fgetc(file)) != EOF) {
        printf("Read character: %c\n", ch);
    }

    // Move the file pointer to the second character
    fseek(file, 1, SEEK_SET);
    ch = fgetc(file); // Read the second character
    printf("Character at position 1: %c\n", ch);

    fclose(file); // Closing the file
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

### Explanation of the Example Code
- The code first opens a file named `example.txt` for writing and writes three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') to it.
- It then closes the file and reopens it for reading.
- The file pointer is moved to the beginning using `fseek()`, and the current position is retrieved using `ftell()`.
- The program reads characters from the file using `fgetc()` and prints them.
- Finally, it moves the file pointer to the second character and reads it again, demonstrating the use of `fseek()` and `fgetc()`.
