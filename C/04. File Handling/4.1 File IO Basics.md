### Notes on File I/O Basics in C

#### 1. Introduction to File I/O
- File I/O (Input/Output) in C allows programs to read from and write to files.
- Files can be text files (human-readable) or binary files (machine-readable).

#### 2. File Pointers
- A file pointer is used to access a file in C.
- It is defined using the `FILE` type from the standard library.

#### 3. Opening a File
- Use the `fopen()` function to open a file.
- Syntax: 
  ```c
  FILE *fopen(const char *filename, const char *mode);
  ```
- **Modes**:
  - `"r"`: Read (file must exist)
  - `"w"`: Write (creates a new file or truncates an existing file)
  - `"a"`: Append (writes data at the end of the file)
  - `"r+"`: Read and write (file must exist)
  - `"w+"`: Read and write (creates a new file or truncates an existing file)
  - `"a+"`: Read and append (creates a new file if it doesn't exist)

#### 4. Reading from a File
- Use functions like `fgetc()`, `fgets()`, or `fread()` to read data.
- Example:
  - `fgetc(FILE *stream)`: Reads a single character.
  - `fgets(char *str, int n, FILE *stream)`: Reads a string until a newline or EOF.
  - `fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *stream)`: Reads binary data.

#### 5. Writing to a File
- Use functions like `fputc()`, `fputs()`, or `fwrite()` to write data.
- Example:
  - `fputc(int char, FILE *stream)`: Writes a single character.
  - `fputs(const char *str, FILE *stream)`: Writes a string.
  - `fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *stream)`: Writes binary data.

#### 6. Closing a File
- Always close a file after operations using `fclose()`.
- Syntax:
  ```c
  int fclose(FILE *stream);
  ```
- This ensures that all data is flushed and resources are released.

#### 7. Error Handling
- Check if the file was opened successfully by verifying the file pointer.
- Use `perror()` or `strerror()` to print error messages.

#### 8. Example Workflow
1. Open a file.
2. Read from or write to the file.
3. Close the file.

### Example Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    FILE *file;
    char buffer[100];

    // Opening a file for writing
    file = fopen("example.txt", "w");
    if (file == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    // Writing to the file
    fputs("Hello, World!\n", file);
    fclose(file); // Closing the file

    // Opening the file for reading
    file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
    if (file == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    // Reading from the file
    while (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), file) != NULL) {
        printf("%s", buffer);
    }

    fclose(file); // Closing the file
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

This code demonstrates how to open a file for writing, write a string to it, close the file, then reopen it for reading, and print its contents to the console. ### Notes on File I/O Basics in C
