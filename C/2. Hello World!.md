C does not have an inbuilt print method, so we need to import a library called ``stdio.h``

Code:
```c 
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```

Line by Line explanation: 
	1. Includes ( or imports ) the ``stdio.h`` library for printing.
	2. Blank Line for Code Readability
	3. Creating a main method. Things to remember:
		1. Code execution starts from here
		2. The arguments are automatically created by your IDE
