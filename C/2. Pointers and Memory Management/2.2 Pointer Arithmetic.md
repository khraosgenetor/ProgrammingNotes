### **Pointer Arithmetic in C**

Pointer arithmetic refers to performing arithmetic operations (such as addition, subtraction, and comparison) on pointers. Since pointers hold memory addresses, pointer arithmetic operates on these addresses in a way that takes into account the size of the data types they point to.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Accessing Memory**:
    
    - Pointers can be used to access specific memory locations by dereferencing them (using `*ptr`).
    - The address stored in the pointer points to a particular variable or array element.
2. **Pointer Addition/Subtraction**:
    
    - **Pointer Addition**: Adding an integer to a pointer moves the pointer forward by that many elements of the data type the pointer points to.
    - **Pointer Subtraction**: Subtracting an integer from a pointer moves it backward by that many elements.
    - **Pointer-to-pointer Subtraction**: You can subtract two pointers (if they point to elements of the same array) to find the number of elements between them.
3. **Pointer Comparison**:
    
    - Pointers can be compared using relational operators like `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` to check whether they point to the same memory location or to determine their relative positions.

### **Pointer Addition Example:**

When you add an integer `n` to a pointer `ptr`, the pointer moves forward by `n` elements of the type it points to. If the pointer is an `int*` (i.e., it points to `int`), adding `1` to `ptr` will actually move the pointer by the size of an `int` (typically 4 bytes on most systems).

#### Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int *ptr = arr;  // Pointer to the first element of arr

    // Pointer Addition
    printf("First element: %d\n", *ptr);       // Output: 10
    ptr++;                                      // Move pointer to the next element
    printf("Second element: %d\n", *ptr);      // Output: 20
    ptr += 2;                                   // Move pointer ahead by 2 elements
    printf("Fourth element: %d\n", *ptr);      // Output: 40

    return 0;
}
```

### **Pointer Subtraction Example:**

When you subtract an integer `n` from a pointer, the pointer moves backward by `n` elements of the type it points to.

#### Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int *ptr = &arr[4];  // Pointer to the last element of arr

    // Pointer Subtraction
    printf("Fifth element: %d\n", *ptr);       // Output: 50
    ptr--;                                      // Move pointer to the previous element
    printf("Fourth element: %d\n", *ptr);      // Output: 40
    ptr -= 2;                                   // Move pointer backward by 2 elements
    printf("Second element: %d\n", *ptr);      // Output: 20

    return 0;
}
```

### **Pointer-to-Pointer Subtraction Example:**

You can subtract two pointers that point to elements within the same array to find how many elements are between them.

#### Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int *ptr1 = &arr[1];  // Pointer to second element (20)
    int *ptr2 = &arr[4];  // Pointer to fifth element (50)

    // Pointer-to-pointer Subtraction
    int diff = ptr2 - ptr1;  // Number of elements between ptr2 and ptr1
    printf("Difference between pointers: %d\n", diff);  // Output: 3

    return 0;
}
```

### **Pointer Comparison Example:**

You can compare pointers to check if they point to the same memory location or which one is ahead in memory.

#### Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int *ptr1 = &arr[1];  // Pointer to second element (20)
    int *ptr2 = &arr[4];  // Pointer to fifth element (50)
    int *ptr3 = &arr[1];  // Pointer to second element again

    // Pointer Comparison
    if (ptr1 == ptr3) {
        printf("ptr1 and ptr3 point to the same memory location.\n");  // This will print
    }

    if (ptr1 != ptr2) {
        printf("ptr1 and ptr2 point to different memory locations.\n");  // This will print
    }

    if (ptr1 < ptr2) {
        printf("ptr1 is before ptr2 in memory.\n");  // This will print
    }

    ptr1 += 3;

    if (ptr1 < ptr2) {
        printf("ptr1 is before ptr2 in memory.\n");  // This will not print
    } else if (ptr2 < ptr1) {
        printf("ptr2 is before ptr1 in memory.\n");  // This will not print
    } else {
        printf("ptr1 and ptr2 point to the same memory location.\n");  // This will print
    }

    int a = 10, b = 5;
    int ar[] = {a, b};

    // Pointer arithmetic: Difference between pointers
    int diff = &ar[1] - &ar[0];  // This will be 1, since they are adjacent elements
    printf("Difference between pointers: %d\n", diff);  // Output the difference as an integer

    return 0;
}

```

### **Summary of Pointer Arithmetic:**

1. **Pointer Addition**: `ptr + n` moves the pointer `n` elements forward.
2. **Pointer Subtraction**: `ptr - n` moves the pointer `n` elements backward.
3. **Pointer-to-pointer Subtraction**: `(ptr2 - ptr1)` returns the number of elements between two pointers.
4. **Pointer Comparison**: Pointers can be compared using `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, etc.

### Important Notes:

- Pointer arithmetic respects the type of the pointer. For example, adding `1` to an `int*` advances the pointer by `sizeof(int)` bytes (typically 4 bytes on most systems).
- Pointer arithmetic is only valid within the bounds of an array, i.e., you cannot perform arithmetic on pointers that point to different arrays or non-contiguous memory locations.
